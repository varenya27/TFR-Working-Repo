## Code Dump for the TFR Project (z-1)
- `data` contains all the data files used in the code
- `main_emcee.py` contains the working code that outputs results and plots for the four datasets (KMOS3D, KROSS, Combined BTFR, Combined STFR); the other `main_emcee...` files contain emcee code for individual datasets
- `plot..` files plot the datasets (simulated and real)
- the different folders contain either figures or files generated from the simulations to test the vertical and orthogonal scatter likelihoods.
